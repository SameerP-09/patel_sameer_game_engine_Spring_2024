# ------------------------------ Colors ------------------------------
# All colors are tuples; tuple: a collection which is ordered and unchangeable
# To create the color black in a computer, set red, green, and blue to min (0)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# To create the color white in a computer, set red, green, and blue to max (255)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# Background color
BGCOLOR = (0, 0, 0)

# In RGB, red is the 1st color (red, green, blue); therefore, red is (255, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# In RGB, green is the 2nd color; therefore, green is (0, 255, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)

# In RGB, blue is the 3rd color; therefore, blue is (0, 0, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)

# To create the color yellow in a computer, combine red and green [in the computer model]
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)

# To create the color light grey in a computer, combine black and white
LIGHTGREY = (217, 217, 214)
